# Risk Flag Prediction: An MLOps End-to-End Project

## ðŸ“œ Introduction

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline designed to predict credit risk. The goal is to build, deploy, and monitor a machine learning model that classifies loan applicants as "High Risk" or "Low Risk" based on their financial and demographic data.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of key MLOps principles, from experiment tracking and model registration to automated deployment and continuous monitoring, using industry-standard tools like MLflow, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow & Architecture

The project follows a standard MLOps lifecycle, as depicted in the workflow below:

1.  **Model Development:** The data preprocessing and model training logic are defined in a Python script.
2.  **Experiment Tracking (MLflow):** Every model training run is tracked with MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and the model artifact.
3.  **Model Registry (MLflow):** The best-performing model is registered in the MLflow Model Registry, where it is versioned and managed.
4.  **CI/CD Trigger:** A push to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository triggers an automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.
5.  **Deployment (AWS):** The pipeline builds a Docker image of the Flask API, pushes it to AWS ECR, and deploys it to a running AWS EC2 instance.
6.  **Real-Time Inference:** The deployed Flask API serves as a real-time inference endpoint, accepting user data and returning predictions.
7.  **Model Monitoring:** The architecture supports continuous monitoring of the deployed model, providing insights into its performance and data drift.

That's a great question. That type of diagram is called ASCII art or a text-based diagram. They are very popular in README files because they are universally rendered correctly and don't require external image files.

These diagrams are created using simple keyboard characters like `+`, `-`, `|`, `>`. While you can type them out manually, there are online tools that make it much easier.

### Recommended Tool: Asciiflow

The easiest way to create or edit a diagram like this is to use a web-based tool called [Asciiflow](https://asciiflow.com/).

1.  **Go to the Asciiflow website:** It provides a simple drag-and-drop interface.
2.  **Draw your boxes and lines:** Use the tools to create the shapes and connect them with arrows.
3.  **Add text:** Type the labels into each box.
4.  **Copy the output:** When you're finished, click the "Copy" button at the bottom.
5.  **Paste into your README:** Paste the copied text into your `README.md` file and make sure to enclose it in a Markdown code block (using three backticks ` ``` `) to preserve the formatting.

For your convenience, here is the exact, corrected diagram you provided, ready for you to copy and paste directly into your README file.
